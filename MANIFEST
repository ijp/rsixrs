(description
"This library is intended to be used for defining your own R6RS-based scheme language like Marco Maggi's (nausicaa) or Racket's racket/gui. It contains a library file showing all the procedures and macros defined in the R6RS, categorised by which library exports them.

Alternatively, it could be used as a replacement for (rnrs), except that it also exports the contents of (rnrs eval), (rnrs mutable-pairs), (rnrs mutable-strings) and (rnrs r5rs).")
